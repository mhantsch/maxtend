The modules are ZMK Studio enabled, so the configuration can be further adapted using [ZMK Studio](https://zmk.studio/).

*Note:* ZMK Studio is still under construction - [Status and list of available features](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio).

After editing, build and flash to install on the keyboard. It handles many more options than ZMK Studio, e.g. combos, macros, changes to behaviours...
