Extended keyboard layers for easy navigation and functionality from a Colemak base layout. (Possibly can be applied to other base layouts, too).

This repository contains various configurations and tooling to create an extended keyboard setup for both Windows and Linux, and a matching configuration for the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com). The configurations start from a Colemak base layout but a lot (or at least some) should also work with other base layouts.

Read more about the [Background](BACKGROUND.md) of this setup.

## Sections
Depending on your OS and preferred setup, find the configurations for each of the different tools in the corresponding subdirectories. 
- For Windows, pick the [ahk](ahk/) configuration (and load via [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)).
- For Linux, choose between either [xkb](xkb/) ([how to configure](xkb/HOWTO), deprecated) or [keyd](keyd/) (recommended, using [the keyd service](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd)).
- Check out [uhk](uhk/) for a matching configuration for the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com) (an external programmable keyboard).
